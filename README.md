# Welcome to LangTrans

LangTrans customizes any programming language. You can make your own syntax for any programming language.

## How does it work?

LangTrans transpiles your syntax into the original syntax.&#x20;

You define tokens from your language, and a template of the original language's syntax, using regular expressions.&#x20;

LangTrans takes both definitions as input and converts code written in the new syntax to the original syntax.
